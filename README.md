[Community Data](/community-data/)
# Data Pipeline

[Our Community Data Repo](/community-data/) contains state, county and zip code data generated for regional [Industry&nbsp;IO&nbsp;Charts](https://model.earth/localsite/info/), [Map&nbsp;Topics](#appview=topics&geoview=country) and [timelines](timelines). &nbsp;View our [Active Projects](/io/).

Our implementation of the [US EPA Industry Input-Output Charts](../../../io/charts/) uses static json files containing [USEEIO API data](https://github.com/modelearth/io/tree/main/build/api) for fast page loads.

# Data Source and Integrations

## US Census - County Business Patterns (CBP)

[We process annual US naics industry levels](industries/naics/)
CSV files are saved for counties and states. Zip and country-wide files coming soon.
Results are used to [compare local industries](../localsite/info)

## US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

We integrate with US EPA's USEEIO and Flowsa (BEA, Energy, Water, more)
[BEA Global Value Chains](https://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics/global-value-chains)


<!--
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - Includes Latitude and Longitude of establishments
-->

## US Census - Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)

Used by [Drawdown Georgia](https://cepl.gatech.edu/projects/Drawdown-Georgia) - [Emissions Dashboard](https://drawdownga.gatech.edu/) for 3-digit NAICS

<a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/qwi.html">Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)</a>  
[QWI provides 2, 3 and 4 digit NAICS Industries](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/schema/latest/lehd_public_use_schema.html#_industry)

<!--
We may combine QWI data with BLS data to estimate 6-digit naics employment and payroll based on the number of firms in a county and additional county attributes.
