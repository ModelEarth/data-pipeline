# Data Pipeline

[Our Community-Data](/community-data/) and [Community-Timelines](https://github.com/modelearth/community-timelines/) repos contain [state, county](industries/naics/) and [zip code data](/community-zipcodes/) generated for [Industry&nbsp;Supply-Chain IO&nbsp;Charts](https://model.earth/localsite/info/) and [Community Forecasting Timelines](timelines).

[Our Industry Input-Output Charts](../io/charts/) pull from static json files containing [USEEIO API state data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/impacts/2020).

[Our International Trade Flow SQL](/profile/trade/) and [USEEIO Javascript](/useeio.js/footprint/) plus [US State USEEIO SQL](/io/about/) provides a structure for models integrated with the [Google Data Commons API](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/) to create [UN Goal Timelines](/data-commons/).<br><br>

<!--
[We meet weekly](/io/coders) to combine data from the [USDA](/data-commons/docs/food/) and [See Click Fix](/feed/view/#feed=311) with [100+ LLMs](/projects/src/).  
We're developing a [Feed Player](/feed/dist/) and [Requests Agent](/requests/) for [Open WebUI](/projects/src) and [Earthscape](/earthscape/app).

# Data Source and Integrations

## US Census - County Business Patterns (CBP)

[We process annual US naics industry levels](timelines/)
CSV files are saved for counties and states. Zip and country-wide files coming soon.
Results are used to [compare local industries](../localsite/info)

## US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

We integrate with US EPA's USEEIO and Flowsa (BEA, Energy, Water, more)
[BEA Global Value Chains](https://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics/global-value-chains)


<!--
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - Includes Latitude and Longitude of establishments
-->

## US Census - Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)

Used by [Drawdown Georgia](https://cepl.gatech.edu/projects/Drawdown-Georgia) - [Emissions Dashboard](https://drawdownga.gatech.edu/) for 3-digit NAICS

<a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/qwi.html">Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)</a>  
[QWI provides 2, 3 and 4 digit NAICS Industries](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/schema/latest/lehd_public_use_schema.html#_industry)

<!--
We may combine QWI data with BLS data to estimate 6-digit naics employment and payroll based on the number of firms in a county and additional county attributes.
