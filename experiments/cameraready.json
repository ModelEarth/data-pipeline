Until the 1970s according to some stories, there were still active bootleggers. The early pottery was used for some of the whiskey as well as during the Crawford Beginnings in many farms.

Much of the area of Crisp County can be easily accessed by even a semi-truck by our road system, which I feel is a great plus, after having watched film crews, and knowing the closer they can get their support vehicles to the project, the better everything flows. We have much rural scenery, small-town flair, older buildings, and a beautiful 8,500-acre Lake Blackshear. Also an easily accessed railroad for those film needs.

Clarkesville (the county seat) was voted by a Rand McNally poll as the number 2 Best Small Town for Retirement in America.\n\r\n\r\n\tHabersham County was formed from two Cherokee Cessions, one on July 8, 1817, and the other on February 27, 1819. It was named for Colonel Joseph Habersham and was originally 31 miles long and 23 miles wide, with an area of 713 square miles. The four main white settlements in the county were Tugaloo, Soque, Nacoochee, and Batesville. Parts of the county were later split off to become part of the counties of Rabun (1828, District 16, on the south side of the Tallulah River), Lumpkin (1831), Banks (1857), White (1858), and Stephens (1905), leaving the present size at 279 square miles. The County now has seven municipalities (Alto, Baldwin, Demorest, Clarkesville, Cornelia, Mt. Airy, and Tallulah Falls.\n\r\n\r\n\tWe love having the movie industry people here, and they love it too. The cast and crew currently here (Jennifer Aniston and 80 to 90 others) say great things about this county. Many have indicated they plan to come back and bring their families. We are a movie-industry friendly community. Our liaison, Joey Duncan, owns Mountain Springs Properties where several of the cast and crew of the Jennifer Aniston movie &quot;Wanderlust&quot; that was filmed in Habersham County are staying. He interfaced with them, escorted them around the county, and got to know them. He is most willing and interested in doing this with other groups.\n\r\n","geo_json":"{\"type\":\"MultiPolygon\",\"coordinates\":[[[[-83.461733,34.478699],[-83.36691,34.658287],[-83.339794,34.677699],[-83.350689,34.709654],[-83.391256,34.728937],[-83.412474,34.727865],[-83.433555,34.736337],[-83.454888,34.725256],[-83.515078,34.719828],[-83.545902,34.745256],[-83.562007,34.778852],[-83.601382,34.818547],[-83.6302,34.81175],[-83.654447,34.815087],[-83.679229,34.794317],[-83.674431,34.775831],[-83.655418,34.776426],[-83.626563,34.758238],[-83.632003,34.743071],[-83.622787,34.72563],[-83.650438,34.65932],[-83.660417,34.657642],[-83.657648,34.634548],[-83.642686,34.613651],[-83.628595,34.539537],[-83.669948,34.50506],[-83.620399,34.436142],[-83.594802,34.449207],[-83.575354,34.474811],[-83.548063,34.487918],[-83.461733,34.478699]]]]}","liaison_id":68,"description":"","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1522052730\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/64368\/habersham-mill-1369238730.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1522052731\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/64368\/jaemor-farms-1369238748.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1522052733\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/64368\/north-georgia-technical-college-1369238768.jpg","photoText3":"","photo4":null,"photoText4":null,"photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Liaisons","edit":"","listing_id":27939,"name":"Hall Camera Ready","office_name":"Lake Lanier CVB","address":"116 Spring St. SE Suite 245","city":"Gainesville","state":"GA","zip":"30501","latitude":"34.299055","longitude":"-83.825545","office_phone":"","local":"(770) 536-5209","local_extension":null,"toll_free_us":null,"toll_free_worldwide":null,"fax":null,"business_email":"stacey@lakelaniercvb.com","booking_email":null,"directions":"","business_url":"","booking_url":"","mobile_url":"","ios_app":"","android_app":"","contact_title":"President","contact_name":"Stacey Dickson","contact_address":"Post Office Box 2995","contact_address2":"","contact_city":"Gainesville","contact_state":"GA","contact_zip":"30503","contact_phone":"(770) 536-5209","contact_phone_extension":"","contact_mobile":"(678) 943-3477","contact_fax":"","contact_email":"stacey@lakelaniercvb.com","contact_website_1":"","contact_website_2":"","hours_sunday":" - ","hours_monday":" - ","hours_tuesday":" - ","hours_wednesday":" - ","hours_thursday":" - ","hours_friday":" - ","hours_saturday":" - ","explore_georgia_categories":null,"population":"139,277","county_seat":"Gainesville","distance_to_capital":"55 miles (about an hour, depending on traffic)","airport_distance":"Local airport is Lee Gilmer in Gainesville.

The total 307 square miles of land is .74% water. The Oconee River borders a portion of the county, while the Ohoopee River, a tributary of the Altamaha River, runs through it. Hunting, fishing and outdoor sports are popular in Johnson County and there are several hunting preserves located here. Each year the city and county host a large Old Fashioned 4th of July Celebration in the downtown area with music, food, arts and crafts, old-fashioned events and a parade.

The Fall Line is where the hilly lands of the Piedmont plateau meet the flat terrain of the coastal plain. As such, Columbus has a varied landscape of rolling hills on the north side and flat plains on the south. The fall line causes rivers in the area to decline rapidly towards sea level, making it a good location for textile mills in the past. The Chattahoochee River is the major river that runs through Columbus. Columbus has a humid subtropical climate. Daytime summer temperatures often reaches a high in the mid 90s, and low temperatures in the winter average in the upper 30s. Columbus is often considered a dividing line or \"natural snowline\" of the southeastern United States with areas north of the city receiving snowfall annually, with areas to the south typically not receiving snowfall every year or at all.","filmography":"\r\n\tWe Were Soldiers, The Fighting Temptations, Tank, Your Mother Wears Combat Boots, The Green Berets, The Phenix City Story\n\r\n","lodging":"Over 4200 Rooms 42 Hotels, 1 Bed 7 Breakfast From Economy to Full Service\n","shopping":"Peachtree Mall Columbus Park Crossing The Landings Shoppes at Bradley Park\n","restaurants":"All of the above!

Washington, the county seat, has more Antebellum homes than any other town in Georgia with historic homes from all notable architectural periods since the 1700s (Federal, Southern Vernacular, Greek Revival, Victorian). The town square, anchored by the Fitzpatrick Hotel (Queen Anne Victorian) and courthouse (Romanesque Revival), reflects a 1900s commercial boom. A former industrial hub from the 1950s-1980s, multiple locations represent the growth\/decline narrative of the Southern small town. Other historic hubs include Tignall (uninhabited 1800s downtown) and Rayle (rural crossroads). Rural land is comprised of rolling pastures, large timber tracts, natural waterways, frontage on Clarks Hill Lake, and 200+ miles of dirt roads.

In 1975, the GOS published his book entitled \"Bird Life of Ben Hill County Georgia and Adjacent Areas.\" Buddy was instrumental in the creation of the Nature Preserve.

Her single-handed efforts against Tories and Indians in the Broad River frontier, as well as her covert activities as a patriot spy, have become the stuff of myth, legend, and local folklore. The Daughters of the American Revolution erected a small park marking the approximate site of Hart's frontier cabin along River Road in Elbert County.

First built as the Grand Opera house around the turn of the 20th Century, the Grand burned in the mid-30s and was rebuilt on the same site in 1936 as an Art Deco movie house with an open roof garden. The roof garden was soon enclosed, but the original railing balusters are still visible on the front. The City secured the property from Martin Theaters after it closed in 1978. The theater was renovated for performing arts space. In 2001, the roof garden space and offices downstairs were renovated. 2011 brought the Barton Organ. The Balcony Club came on board in 2015 and ADA loggias were added in 2015 and 2016. <br>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":null,"photoText1":null,"photo2":null,"photoText2":null,"photo3":null,"photoText3":null,"photo4":null,"photoText4":null,"photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":26977,"name":"Springfield","office_name":null,"address":"130 S.

The place where Martin Luther King Jr. would come to relax, play baseball and rehearse his speeches before giving them during the Civil Rights Movement. The Boy\u2019s Dormitory is still standing and the room that MLK Jr. slept in is still in the same condition as when he last stepped foot in it. The Dorchester Academy was founded in 1869 by the American Missionary Association (now the United Church of Christ) as a school for freed slaves. By 1917, the fully accredited high school had an enrollment of 300 students.  Although the academic program ended in the 1940\u2019s when a consolidated school for black youth was built in nearby Riceboro, the pioneering spirit did not.  In the 1940s, the Dorchester Cooperative Center was established and the Dorchester Academy would become an institute for community development, political and social change.  The Liberty County Citizen\u2019s Council, founded in 1946, helped register and organize African-American voters.  Nearly 20 years later, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other key figures in the civil rights movement including Dr. Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Dr. Fred Shuttlesworth, prepared for \u201cProject C\u201d which would be later memorialized as the infamous Birmingham march, one of the first major victories in the civil rights movement.  Today, the Dorchester Academy is a National Landmark and serves as an African-American history museum and community center and is in the process of developing a community educational and research center.  Additionally, plans are in place to renovate the beautiful Greek Revival style boys\u2019 dormitory, one of the only original Dorchester Academy buildings that remain. The site was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and was designated a National Landmark in 2006.","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521833539\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37032\/P6090668.jpg","photoText1":"The Room where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stayed.

These early baptisms were carried out in affiliation with the White North Newport Church. After the white congregation moved to Walthourville in 1854, the enslaved Africans renamed the church the First African Baptist Church and continued the practice of the ritual baptisms at the site until the early 1940s.

The plantation played important roles in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the industrial revolution. It continues to play a prominent role in American society today as one of our nation's leading luxury communities and private sporting clubs. \u00a0The Ford Plantation encompasses land that was once home to three plantations: Dublin (later renamed Richmond; established 1747) Silk Hope (est. 1750), Cherry Hill (est. 1770). Dikes and irrigation systems for growing rice were built. Following a break in agricultural activities during the Revolutionary War, the Plantations added upland cotton and other crops to their primary cash crop: tidal rice. Soon, a booming economy allowed the Plantations to expand and rise to prominence for three-quarters of a century. \u00a0In 1936, Henry Ford broke ground for a beautiful Greek revival style mansion on the banks of the Ogeechee River. The grand house, made of Savannah-gray brick, had marble steps, air conditioning, and an elevator. It sat on 55 acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens. The house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and the DuPonts. It remains the centerpiece of The Ford Plantation today. \u00a0 \u00a0After the Fords' deaths, the land changed ownership several times over the years and eventually became the personal estate of Saudi Arabian businessman Gaith Pharaon in the 1980s. He built a private, world-class golf course, designed by Pete Dye.<\/p>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1522046044\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/62869\/ford.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1522046046\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/62869\/ford2.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":null,"photoText3":null,"photo4":null,"photoText4":null,"photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":28787,"name":"Kinloch Plantation","office_name":null,"address":"297 McMillen Rd.

Award-winning Seabrook Village is a unique, African-American living history museum.  The Seabrook community was established through federal land grants made possible by General William T. Sherman's Field Order 15 (1865), a policy that came to be known as \"forty-acres-and-a-mule.\" Freedmen settled as landowners on the same lands they had once worked as slaves. Armed with little but their newly found freedom, a plot of land, and the determination to build a brighter future for themselves and their children and grandchildren, the freedmen of Seabrook represent the African-American pioneer experience.  Eight turn-of-the-century buildings offer visitors an authentic feel for African-American life and culture from 1865 to 1930.  Almost all artifacts, land and structures have been donated by collectors and members of the local community.  Visit the one-room Seabrook School where \"reading, writing and 'rithmetic were taught to the tune of a hick'ry stick.\"  Or, try your hand at grinding corn into meal and grits or washing clothes on a scrub board.  Planned group visits are fully interactive as costumed interpreters engage visitors in all aspects of old time village life. Ongoing exhibits include the grave art of Cyrus Bowens and the Willis Hakim J. Hones Material Culture Collection of handmade items from a peanut roaster to twig furniture.","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521855311\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39165\/DSCF9207.jpg","photoText1":"The one-room schoolhouse.

The farm is still active and has close to 300 head of cattle. At the heart of the farm is a beautiful restored 1820's farmhouse that is still lived in and available for filming. Besides many beautiful landscapes the farm contains many historical outbuildings, a barn still in use from the 1800's, a general store from the early 1900's, and the ruins of a 1840's tenant house. The site is in excellent condition and is very remote and isolated. There is very little traffic in this area or sound pollution. The family is open to filming on the property and is willing to work with production companies.<\/p>\n<p>Jimmy McDonald is the contact for the family who owns the farm.

In 1975, the school closed and fell into disrepair, but a group of citizens passionate about historic preservation rallied together to protect the school.\u00a0 This led to the building's listing on the National Register of Historic Places and its renovation into a center with the original mission to enrich the quality of life for people of all ages in South Georgia and North Florida through cultural and educational experiences in the arts and humanities. This mission has guided us for more than two decades, and continues to be the driving force behind the Center. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521860494\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39714\/ThomasvilleCenterforArts2.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521860492\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39714\/ThomasvilleCenterforArts.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":null,"photoText3":null,"photo4":null,"photoText4":null,"photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":3995,"name":"Wild Animal Safari","office_name":null,"address":"1300 Oak Grove Rd.

Besides the organic farm with its modern greenhouses, the farm contains a historic farmhouse (The Nunn Homestead), a new event barn (with restrooms inside), a small store for the farm, numerous sheds and barns, and two unique historic grain silos. Since opening in 2008 the Atlanta Braves have filed a commercial here and GPTV has filmed several shows about the farm.

Main Street in Hinesville.  In October 1892 the brick jail was completed on what was at that time the south end of Hinesville and replaced a one story wood jail. The site and date of construction of the first jail are unknown. The architect is unknown, but the contractor was a man by the name of Mr. Parkhill. The architecture of the jail is typical of penal facilities of that time period in towns of similar size in the southeast. The jail was used until 1970, when a new regional prison facility was completed. The jail was auctioned off and purchased by the Liberty County Historical Society for the sum of $4,500. According to restoration documentation, \u201cThe Old Liberty Jail is a significant example of a late 19th century jail for an agricultural county and a small, but growing, community in Georgia. It is one of the earliest brick structures in Hinesville and probably Liberty County.\u201d It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521850827\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38671\/OldLiberty.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521850817\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38671\/old-liberty-county-jail.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521850820\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38671\/IMG_1749.jpg","photoText3":"","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521850823\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38671\/IMG_1758.jpg","photoText4":"","photo5":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521850825\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38671\/IMG_1768.jpg","photoText5":"","photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":28068,"name":"Edison","office_name":null,"address":"19437 Hartford St. ","city":"Edison","state":"GA","zip":"39846","latitude":"31.558136","longitude":"-84.738085","office_phone":null,"local":"(229) 835-2279","local_extension":null,"toll_free_us":null,"toll_free_worldwide":null,"fax":null,"business_email":null,"booking_email":null,"directions":"","business_url":"","booking_url":"","mobile_url":"","ios_app":"","android_app":"","contact_title":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"contact_address2":null,"contact_city":null,"contact_state":null,"contact_zip":null,"contact_phone":null,"contact_phone_extension":null,"contact_mobile":null,"contact_fax":null,"contact_email":null,"contact_website_1":null,"contact_website_2":null,"hours_sunday":" -

The Town will openly work with any production and can provide office or meeting space as an incentive to help productions out.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Contact info: Jennifer Dees, Braselton Town Manager, Work: 706-654-3915 Ext. 8 - Email: <a href=\"mailto:jdees@braselton.net\" target=\"_blank\">jdees@braselton.net<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126823\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69487.jpg","photoText1":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126827\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69512.jpg","photoText2":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126829\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69511.jpg","photoText3":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126831\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69510.jpg","photoText4":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo5":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126833\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69509.jpg","photoText5":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo6":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126808\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69507.jpg","photoText6":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo7":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126815\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69506.jpg","photoText7":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo8":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126817\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69504.jpg","photoText8":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo9":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126818\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69501.jpg","photoText9":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","photo10":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126819\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28324\/69492.jpg","photoText10":"Braselton Brothers Department Store Building","document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":165,"name":"Around Back at Rocky's Place","office_name":null,"address":"3631 GA Hwy. 53 E.

The beautiful Victorian Gothic structure was built by &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Henry Harding Tift, a Connecticut Yankee, who founded Tifton. &nbsp; Constructed in 1900 and once hailed as &ldquo;the finest church in the South,&rdquo;&rsquo; the 3,500 square-foot building&rsquo;s rather simple exterior opens to reveal an expansive octagonal-shaped interior, rich with color and ornamentation. The fine-grained heart pine lumber of the interior walls and ceiling were handcrafted by ship carpenters. The vaulted ceiling is supported by massive arched buttresses, while intricate carved medallions and bull&rsquo;s-eye plinth blocks on the door and window moldings serve as a counterpoint to the ceiling&rsquo;s magnificent height and strength. The original bell tower, topped with an elegant brass final, is still intact. &nbsp; But the true jewels of the building are the twenty-four stained and fired glass windows, which suffuse the building with light and color.&nbsp; Three triplet ecclesiastical windows each feature unusual designs, glass and color. All the exterior and interior doors are graced with stained glass transoms. Many of the rondels and glass d&eacute;cor in the windows were available only in Italy at the time the building was constructed.&nbsp; The Museum was renovated and re-opened and dedicated in the spring of 1997.\r\n","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521860671\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39729\/MuseumofArt3.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521860673\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39729\/churchinterior.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521860675\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39729\/Tifton2-40.jpg","photoText3":"","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521860677\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/39729\/TiftonMuseum--.jpg","photoText4":"","photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":4009,"name":"Willis Park","office_name":null,"address":"101 S.

It sits on close to 70 acres of land. There are several historical barns and outbuildings surrounding the property. There is also a storm shelter in the backyard and an old well on the back porch. The house is old but in good condition for its age. It has a lot of upkeep. There is no central AC\/Heat. The owner, Ms. Braselton is very open to filming. As of July 2013 the property is vacant. She rents the home from time to time but is very selective in whom she rents it to. The farmhouse sits about 100 feet off of Davis St., which is not a high traffic street. Home sits among a pecan tree orchard.<\/p>\n<p>Contact info: Jennifer Scott, Braselton Town Manager - Work: 706-654-3915 Ext. 8 - Email:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:jscott@braselton.net\" target=\"_blank\">jscott@braselton.net<\/a><\/p>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126899\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68362.jpg","photoText1":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126900\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68365.jpg","photoText2":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126902\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68366.jpg","photoText3":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126904\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68368.jpg","photoText4":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo5":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126906\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68371.jpg","photoText5":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo6":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126908\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68378.jpg","photoText6":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo7":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126909\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68387.jpg","photoText7":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo8":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126916\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28330\/68394.jpg","photoText8":"Braselton Davis St. Farmhouse","photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":1707,"name":"Happy Valley Pottery, Inc.","office_name":null,"address":"1210 Carson Graves Rd.

The primary use of the mill was as a grist and roller mill. The mill was actively used up until the early 1960's. The Town of Braselton currently owns the mill and has done a lot of work to preserve the structure. The inside machinery of this structure is simply amazing. It is like someone locked the doors 70 or 80 years ago and you are seeing it for the first time the doors are opened. Though there is power to the outside of the building there are no active utilities inside. The mill is surrounded by busy roads; noise may have to be addressed.<\/p>\n<p>Contact info: Jennifer Scott, Braselton Town Manager - Work: 706-654-3915 Ext. 8 - Email:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:jscott@braselton.net\" target=\"_blank\">jscott@braselton.net<\/a><\/p>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126918\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69374.jpg","photoText1":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126917\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69373.jpg","photoText2":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126920\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69379.jpg","photoText3":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126922\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69380.jpg","photoText4":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo5":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126923\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69381.jpg","photoText5":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo6":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126925\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69384.jpg","photoText6":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo7":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126927\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69385.jpg","photoText7":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo8":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126928\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69387.jpg","photoText8":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo9":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126930\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69388.jpg","photoText9":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","photo10":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1530126932\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/28331\/69396.jpg","photoText10":"Braselton Enterprise Roller Mill","document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":172,"name":"Ashantilly Center, Inc.","office_name":null,"address":"15591 GA Hwy. 99 ","city":"Darien","state":"GA","zip":"31305","latitude":"31.387588","longitude":"-81.411901","office_phone":null,"local":"(912) 437-4473","local_extension":null,"toll_free_us":null,"toll_free_worldwide":null,"fax":null,"business_email":"ashantillycenter@gmail.com","booking_email":"ashantillycenter@gmail.com","directions":"","business_url":"http:\/\/www.ashantilly.org","booking_url":"","mobile_url":"","ios_app":"","android_app":"","contact_title":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"contact_address2":null,"contact_city":null,"contact_state":null,"contact_zip":null,"contact_phone":null,"contact_phone_extension":null,"contact_mobile":null,"contact_fax":null,"contact_email":null,"contact_website_1":null,"contact_website_2":null,"hours_sunday":" -

Come visit the site of America's greatest contribution to medicine and learn how this \"country doctor\" came to be the father of painless surgery. The mid-1800s Pendergrass General Store building traces the development of goods available to small town residents over time.

The airport is on over 250+ acres and has a runway that is over 5000 feet long. The airport is very open to filming and possible use of hanger space for temporary sound stages. The airport is very well maintained and has many different buildings and hangars of various ages and conditions. The airport is owned by the Jackson County Board of Commissioners and is ran and overseen by an airport manager and an airport authority board. The biggest restriction involves closing the runway due to FAA regulations.

It is believed to have the oldest continually operated lanes in the State of Georgia. Jefferson Lanes is a vintage retro styled bowling alley that is like taking a step back in time.

The protection of life and property, the preservation of public tranquility, and the absence of crime, will alone prove whether those efforts have been successful and whether the objects for which the police were appointed have been attained.\u201d I find, with some degree of humor, that it was the Saxons which brought the earliest tribal system of policing to England, which is the home of the modern model of policing. <br>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1603291351\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/ad15a1ed37e10f3afd69691fab8b3df0_CRTACcrossingroad309.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1603291290\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/af339d1d7e60d000e4e09850316ab4ef_CRTACcrossingroad283.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1603291270\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/d524c2c7cf9b59b985d4fb97a9c13eb6_CRTACcrossingroad280.jpg","photoText3":"","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1602877958\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/66f6586351eb03ad616814a0f2dbecca_CRTACcrossingroad275.jpg","photoText4":"","photo5":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1602877995\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/34dcb27e9de76b8db78c74c008a69bc8_CRTACcrossingroad294.jpg","photoText5":"","photo6":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1602878057\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/4836203c8710042b321c0c168fc8b8a8_CRTACcrossingroad274.jpg","photoText6":"","photo7":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1603291380\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/41dd5d7ddd8d24685d81ff16c7c65ca4_CRTACcrossingroad281.jpg","photoText7":"","photo8":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1603291395\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/9e7c03e507002e67a96d8a9ea4d64731_2020-06-03183146.jpg","photoText8":"","photo9":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1603291408\/Georgia\/account_photos\/27882\/2f18431e785cb44b76d0f4ef6f787645_2020-06-03183139.jpg","photoText9":"","photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":221,"name":"Auchumpkee Creek Covered Bridge","office_name":null,"address":"Allen Rd., Hwy. 80 ","city":"Thomaston","state":"GA","zip":"30286","latitude":"32.888188","longitude":"-84.326585","office_phone":null,"local":"(706) 647-9686","local_extension":null,"toll_free_us":null,"toll_free_worldwide":null,"fax":null,"business_email":null,"booking_email":null,"directions":"","business_url":"http:\/\/www.thomastongachamber.com\/auchumpkee-creek-covered-bridge","booking_url":"","mobile_url":"","ios_app":"","android_app":"","contact_title":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"contact_address2":null,"contact_city":null,"contact_state":null,"contact_zip":null,"contact_phone":null,"contact_phone_extension":null,"contact_mobile":null,"contact_fax":null,"contact_email":null,"contact_website_1":null,"contact_website_2":null,"hours_sunday":"12:00:00 AM -

Conceived as a vital cultural hub, the center was designed by the multi-national architectural firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and Associates to artistically enrich the Chattahoochee Valley region.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A property of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the 245,000-square-foot RiverCenter is a visually stunning blend of the past and the present, mixing the brick and ironwork of the area's historic buildings with a modern multi-level glass and steel fa\u00e7ade. Its spacious entrance is graced by a tall glass \"curtain\" wall and a soaring staircase.\u00a0\u00a0 RiverCenter's state-of-the-art facilities include the 2,000-seat Bill Heard Theatre, the center's main venue and home to the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. Featuring orchestra, mezzanine and balcony seating, the hall is designed to meet the complex technical needs of attractions such as Broadway shows, symphonic concerts, dance performances, pop concerts, lectures and conferences. From the ceiling large interwoven ribbons of steel mesh contribute a sense of intimacy, while shaped balcony fascias and custom light fixtures provide color, texture and warmth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The center's second largest performance space, Legacy Hall, has 430 seats and an elegant ambiance that includes orchestra and parterre levels and a balcony that wraps entirely around the stage. Walls are covered in a textured clay tile, and the balcony and parterre fascias are covered in rich cherry wood. From the ceiling a series of light, colored wood acoustical reflectors support striking copper chandeliers. Known for its perfect acoustics and impressive Jordan Concert Organ, the hall is a popular venue with many noted musicians.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legacy Hall and the facility's 150-seat, black-box Studio Theater also provide rehearsal and performance space for the Columbus State University Schwob School of Music. The music school's classrooms, studios, rehearsal rooms and practice rooms also are located at RiverCenter.<\/p>","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521853815\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38992\/IMG_1111.jpg","photoText1":"RiverCenter for the Performing Arts","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521853822\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38992\/InsideSide1.jpg","photoText2":"Bill Heard Theater","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521853828\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38992\/RivCenRaftersOriginal.jpg","photoText3":"Bill Heard Theater","photo4":null,"photoText4":null,"photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":11487,"name":"Heavy's Barbeque","office_name":null,"address":"2288 Sparta Rd.

The Iron Works was organized in 1853 and was built near the steamboat landing in the heart of the growing community. Today the buildings are a local landmark in the downtown area and houses the Columbus Georgia Convention and Trade Center. Nearby are first-class sleeping accommodations, restaurants, and entertainment facilities.&nbsp; The Columbus Iron Works produced a variety of equipment on this site for over a century. Aside from farming implements and mechanical gears used by local textile businesses, it produced firearms for the Confederacy during the Civil War. It also produced machinery to drive at least fourteen naval vessels in the Confederate fleet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1970&rsquo;s the company had substantially outgrown the old buildings and moved to new facilities on the outskirts of town. In 1975 the City of Columbus became involved with the buildings. Plans were formulated for a downtown convention center and this building had potential to serve in that capacity. Through a careful blending of the old and new, the Columbus Georgia Convention and Trade Center was created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The massive structures of the Iron Works appear little changed from the last century. The old brick walls, huge timbers and exposed ceilings, representing the best of 19th century craftsmanship, create an ambience unknown to modern construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The building has over 182,000 square feet of floor space with the 17 meeting rooms satisfying a variety of needs and seating as many as 500 or as few as 20. All spaces provide the most modern lighting, and staging equipment are also available. The Trade Center houses a new state-of-the art on-site kitchen with the capacity and staff to prepare up to 4,000 meals at a time. There is also a concession area available for trade shows, located between the exhibit halls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loading dock facilities allow an easy entrance to the exhibit halls for setups. Ramps and elevators also make the Trade Center accessible to persons with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheltered access is provided to both levels of the complex from a 426 car, multi-level garage. In addition to the garage, ground level parking lots are located around the complex perimeter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521825415\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/36617\/18612-1377.jpg","photoText1":"Back View","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521825417\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/36617\/Columbusconvention1.jpg","photoText2":"","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521825419\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/36617\/Columbusconvention3.jpg","photoText3":"","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521825421\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/36617\/Columbusconvention1-.jpg","photoText4":"","photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":1248,"name":"Elachee Nature Science Center","office_name":null,"address":"2125 Elachee Dr. ","city":"Gainesville","state":"GA","zip":"30504","latitude":"34.249651","longitude":"-83.845531","office_phone":null,"local":"(770) 535-1976","local_extension":null,"toll_free_us":null,"toll_free_worldwide":null,"fax":"(770) 535-2302","business_email":"elachee@elachee.org","booking_email":null,"directions":"","business_url":"http:\/\/www.elachee.org","booking_url":"","mobile_url":"","ios_app":"","android_app":"","contact_title":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"contact_address2":null,"contact_city":null,"contact_state":null,"contact_zip":null,"contact_phone":null,"contact_phone_extension":null,"contact_mobile":null,"contact_fax":null,"contact_email":null,"contact_website_1":null,"contact_website_2":null,"hours_sunday":" - ","hours_monday":"10:00:00 AM - 05:00:00 PM","hours_tuesday":"10:00:00 AM - 05:00:00 PM","hours_wednesday":"10:00:00 AM - 05:00:00 PM","hours_thursday":"10:00:00 AM - 05:00:00 PM","hours_friday":"10:00:00 AM - 05:00:00 PM","hours_saturday":"10:00:00 AM - 05:00:00 PM","explore_georgia_categories":"Trails & Tours, Museums, Wildlife Viewing, Special Event Facilities","population":null,"county_seat":null,"distance_to_capital":null,"airport_distance":null,"topograhy":null,"filmography":null,"lodging":null,"shopping":null,"restaurants":null,"hospitals":null,"media":null,"notes":null,"geo_json":null,"liaison_id":null,"description":"A gift from the Johnson & Johnson Company who operated a bandage factory here during the WWII era, Elachee is both a passive recreation center and interactive science center.

The town's history is also revealed in the street names in Evergreen Cemetery, the same name as the cemetery over which the famous Civil War Battle at Gettysburg was fought.<br><br>The story of that battle is told in the street names in the historical northwest section of the cemetery, west of the Cemetery Road entrance. Remarkably, the area was laid out in a manner which mimics the terrain and army positions of the battle. Look for Taneytown Road, Cemetery Ridge Road, Emmitsburg Road and Seminary Ridge Road and Little Round Top Lane, named for the hill where Colonel Lawrence Chamberlain led a daring bayonet charge at Gettysburg.<br><br>The founding story of Fitzgerald is told in all the other street signs. In the south section you will find Drew Brothers Road which honors the family who sold the original land on which the Colony City was established. Swan Lane is named for the two-decker steamer on which the Drew family traveled from North Carolina to South Georgia. P. H. Fitzgerald Drive celebrates the founder of Fitzgerald, an Indiana pension attorney for Union soldiers who conceived the idea of this veterans' colony in the south, which became his namesake. Midway Avenue was the main thoroughfare through Shacktown, a collection of pine stacks where thousands of colonists lived in the founding days. Confederate Lane and Union Road run in front of graves of these pioneering veterans. Palace Road recognizes the Corn and Cotton Palace, a huge structure built in 1896 where Union and Confederate veterans - former enemies who founded Fitzgerald - \"marched as one\" for the first time behind one flag. <br><br>Fitzgerald\u2019s Evergreen Cemetery is one of the nicest and well maintained publicly owned cemeteries in the state of Georgia.<br>Public Works' duties include but are not limited to maintaining and mowing 86+ acres of cemetery space.<br><br>\u200bMr. Neal Poole, the Cemetery Supervisor, is available to help <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sgrcmaps.com\/evergreen\/\">locate plots<\/a>\u00a0and aid in preparing final resting places.

It was named after Revolutionary War hero, Elijah Clarke, and onsite are the home and graves of Clarke and his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521835057\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37152\/IMG0028.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521835046\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37152\/cabin_museum1.jpg","photoText2":"Elijah Clark State Park","photo3":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521835051\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37152\/BOATING.jpg","photoText3":"Boating","photo4":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521835065\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37152\/ClassicSouth_ElijahClark_PierFishing042.jpg","photoText4":"","photo5":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521835071\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37152\/ElijahClarkbeach007.jpg","photoText5":"","photo6":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521835073\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/37152\/Elijah_Clark2-full.jpg","photoText6":"Cottage","photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":2280,"name":"Laney-Walker Historic District","office_name":null,"address":"600-1400 Blocks Laney-Walker Blvd. ","city":"Augusta","state":"GA","zip":"30901","latitude":"33.456284","longitude":"-81.942570","office_phone":null,"local":"(706) 823-6600","local_extension":null,"toll_free_us":null,"toll_free_worldwide":null,"fax":null,"business_email":null,"booking_email":null,"directions":"","business_url":"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/nr\/travel\/augusta\/laneywalkerhd.html","booking_url":"","mobile_url":"","ios_app":"","android_app":"","contact_title":null,"contact_name":null,"contact_address":null,"contact_address2":null,"contact_city":null,"contact_state":null,"contact_zip":null,"contact_phone":null,"contact_phone_extension":null,"contact_mobile":null,"contact_fax":null,"contact_email":null,"contact_website_1":null,"contact_website_2":null,"hours_sunday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","hours_monday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","hours_tuesday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","hours_wednesday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","hours_thursday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","hours_friday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","hours_saturday":"12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00 AM","explore_georgia_categories":"Historic Sites, Trails & Tours","population":null,"county_seat":null,"distance_to_capital":null,"airport_distance":null,"topograhy":null,"filmography":null,"lodging":null,"shopping":null,"restaurants":null,"hospitals":null,"media":null,"notes":null,"geo_json":null,"liaison_id":null,"description":"","amenities":"","other1":"","other2":"","other3":"","other4":"","other5":"","other6":"","other7":"","other8":"","other9":"","other10":"","photo1":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/miles-extranet-dev\/image\/upload\/v1521846427\/Georgia\/migration_photos\/38212\/LaneyWalker.jpg","photoText1":"","photo2":null,"photoText2":null,"photo3":null,"photoText3":null,"photo4":null,"photoText4":null,"photo5":null,"photoText5":null,"photo6":null,"photoText6":null,"photo7":null,"photoText7":null,"photo8":null,"photoText8":null,"photo9":null,"photoText9":null,"photo10":null,"photoText10":null,"document1":null,"documentText1":null,"document2":null,"documentText2":null,"document3":null,"documentText3":null,"document4":null,"documentText4":null,"document5":null,"documentText5":null,"document6":null,"documentText6":null,"document7":null,"documentText7":null,"document8":null,"documentText8":null,"document9":null,"documentText9":null,"document10":null,"documentText10":null,"video1":null,"video2":null,"video3":null,"video4":null,"video5":null,"video6":null,"video7":null,"video8":null,"video9":null,"video10":null},{"tag":"Locations","edit":"","listing_id":2536,"name":"Moody Forest Natural Area","office_name":null,"address":"3553 E.

Extensive information is also provided about Toombs' wife, Julia, their children, and the slaves who were essential to the running of the home and plantation. <br><br>The home itself is expertly decorated and furnished in period appropriate style, conveying at times the sense that one has entered Toombs' residence while he just happened to be out. From the original furniture to the architecture oddities, such as the gasoliers, the home offers a unique glimpse into domestic life during the 19th century.\" <br><br><\/p><p>\"Defend yourselves, the enemy is at your door,\" thundered Robert Toombs from the Senate floor on Jan. 24, 1860. It was a turning point in history. Rejecting moderation, Toombs helped lead Georgia to secession and the Civil War. The story is told in exhibits at his restored and furnished home.<\/p><br><p>Toombs was a state legislator, U.S. congressman and senator. With ambitions of becoming president of the Confederacy, he resented Jefferson Davis' election. Toombs reluctantly accepted appointment as Secretary of State before resigning to take a commission in the Army of Northern Virginia. When his ambitions were frustrated, he resigned and spent the remainder of the war years in Washington, Georgia, brooding and criticizing the Confederate government. His last service to Georgia was helping create the Constitution of 1877, which was not amended until 1945.<\/p><br><p>Tour the house and grounds, view exhibits and displays.
