# Timeline Data Samples

Our timeline chart work resides at [data-commons/docs/data](/data-commons/docs/data)

The samples here use a tabulator script in their index.html page.
For [our tabulator chart pages](../training/naics/), we reuse a common function in earthscape.js.

Table2 - Appends names of industries after table loads with [NAICS Lookup](https://model.earth/community-data/us/id_lists/industry_id_list.csv) <!-- Dinesh-->

<!--
Table4 - Loops through files from 2017 to 2020 using Javascript. - Rupesh
-->

Table4 - Data is pivoted into year rows (1 row per year) <!-- Dinesh-->

<!--
TO DO table5 - Add and populate a Density column using Population/Km2. [Data source](https://model.earth/community-timelines/training/naics4/US/counties/2017/US-AK-training-naics4-counties-2017.csv) - Km2 is not yet in CSV.
